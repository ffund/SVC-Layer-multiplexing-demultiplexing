# SVC-Layer-multiplexing-demultiplexing
This repository is a simple modification of the standard JSVM software for Scalable Video Encoding and Decoding
such that different layers of a scalable stream can be extracted from the original full quality stream (demultiplexing)
and independently transmitted over a network. Then, at the receiver end, multiplexing is done to regenerate the original
stream and decoding.
